Current options… £500 gets you an electric vaccine cooler, so need to
lower the price towards the £200 range. Looking at insulation can be
useful to try and reduce cost, but can let kitty do this as it would be
more involved for the manufacturing process.

All options seem to be just boxes with handles and seem to be very
expensive. Smile does fix this sort of.

met for time. Can always underfill, so need to think of a cheap way to

box.<br />
Could look at improving attachment mechanisms to add more vaccines? Or
make it more versatile.<br />
Maybe a sock/strap type thing like in a toolbox to make it really thin

portable and easier to transport while still having the maximum
utility</p>

filled (currently 3 vaccines per section *18 sections).<br />
Smaller journeys will need less vaccines as they would probably be
limited by the number of patients in one day</p></th>

cap. Could look at removing that cap and replacing it with foam. Foam
would also mean that if the specific bottle goes out of sale, a slightly
different one could be used.</p>

bottle e.g. a flexible ring constraint around bottle base</p></th>
<th>Simple so that it is easy to use and repair - use minimal parts and
