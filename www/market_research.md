title: Market Research

<sup>Article by Caio Bezerra</sup>



We began by talking to Kitty with what she would like us to do. She got
us started on looking into the UK market, and what applications the box
would work on. We looked into the potential options, but none
of them seemed appropriate. We asked for kittys market research, and
found that typically vaccination travel rounds last for upwards of 5
hours, which is already enough that a medic may not wish to extend this
time further. There was also a lack of people in a position of buying power to ask futher questions with meaningful answers.

We then talked to personal connections we know to see if there would be a
smaller personal ice box market, however this also backfired, as most
people in that market would not need their medication cold or much
longer than a few hours, and can do so with a small box when on holiday
etc. We even looked at a potential vet market as they must travel large distances to rural farms with their vaccines.

The conclusion we came to was that the NHS and personal markets were no good. We
proposed a second market to Kitty of a third world country where the
journeys are less dangerous than those currently taken, but still
require a lot of vaccinations in one go. We then looked at current large
capacity cold boxes, and how the existing smile addresses those issues. This led us to conclude that shrinking the smile would be viable for such a market, but some key constraints applied that would be different to a box in the west.

Current options seem to be worse than the smile in almost every way. The SMILE, although more expensive, seems to be much more valuable for the money, giving a very clear market edge. All options seem to be just boxes with handles and seem to be very expensive. This could be due to them not being designed for being carried, but the core specifications are also not very appealing for the market. The alternatives are also quite limited, as the same few companies seem to show up frequently, so some competitive diversity in the market for mid sized Vaccine carriers would not do badly.

Though the smile may be slightly more hassle to load and unload due to the small opening, you cannot argue that it is less effective. For the goal we are aiming for, the number of vaccines and cold time may be quite overkill, and so looking at making sensible cuts will hopefully drastically cut the cost, allowing us to make one which is competitive in the market costwise, and can slot into hospitals which already use the smile well with the modularity we are aiming for.
