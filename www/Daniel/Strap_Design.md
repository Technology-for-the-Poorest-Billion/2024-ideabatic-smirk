## Strap Design

I have started prototyping different modular strap designs to test for both the Smile and the Mini Smile. I started by creating a mock-up of the Mini Smile out of cardboard, shown below:

I then designed and prototyped modular attaching clips which can be glued to botht the Smile and the Mini Smile. These allow interchangeable straps to be attached to the Mini Smile/Smile, and thus allow user customisability to attach whatever strap configuration is most comfortable for them. The straps can also be removed, allowing the box to be used un-altered as before. Photographs of the attachment points are below:

Straps were then prototyped out of cardboard with a width of 40mm. I plan on trying these out, along with 70mm-wide straps on a field test where I walk around with the Smile protoype weighted to the correct mass. This will allow me to identify which set of straps is more ergonomic, and the modularity of the strap-retaining mechanism glued to the box means that both I, and any end user, can easily swap of straps for the most comfortable for them. Perhaps it will be suggested that the default Smile straps are thicker than the default Mini Smile ones due to the higher anticipated weight of the Smile. However the straps will of course be interchangeable. Here are some photographs of the straps:

And how they attach to the box:

I have completed some preliminary field tests with the straps, and these are photographed below:

I have also explored the possibility of front-mounting the Mini Smile. Advantages of this include enhanced protection for the vaccines (unlikely to bump the Mini Smile into things), and possible on-the-fly acces to the Mini Smile's contents.

At the moment the straps have to be held to keep the Mini Smile in place, but I am exploring options for lengthening the straps and attaching both ends to the Mini Smile so that it can be carried hands-free.
