## Further Strap Research

#### Requirements

Functions the straps **must** perform:
* Carry the weight of the Miniature Smile >2kg
* Adjust to fit body size
* Not significantly increase weight of Smile
  * Should not weigh more than the current backpack design for the larger Smile
* Be padded to provide comfortable fit for health worker
* Have strong attachments to Smile box
  
Functions the straps **could** perform:
* Provide option for shoulder carrying
* Provide option for backpack carrying
* Have ability to fit larger smile by same attachments
* Should carry the weight of the large Smile >3.5kg
* Integrate vaccine recording cards

#### Conventional Rucksack-style Straps

This is similar to the type of strap that was initially prototyped and featured in the interim presentation. A photo is included below:

The major difference between this strap and the one prototyped is that this strap would wrap around so that both sides would be attached to the Smile's body. This would mean that it could be carried hands-free as the wearer's hands aren't required to keep the box and straps in place. This strap is evaluated below:

Would fulfill:
* Carry the weight of the Miniature Smile >2kg
* Adjust to fit body size
* Have strong attachments to Smile box
* Provide option for backpack carrying
* Should carry the weight of the large Smile >3.5kg
* Not significantly increase weight of Smile
  * Should not weigh more than the current backpack design for the larger Smile

Would be challenging to fulfill:

* Be padded to provide comfortable fit for health worker
* Provide option for shoulder carrying
* Have ability to fit larger smile by same attachments
* Integrate vaccine recording cards

This idea is of the more conventional type, which means that there should be lots of widely-available information on it's design and how it could be manufactured. This is a solid proposal and very similar to the one the group last year researched.


#### Guitar Strap

Guitars typically weigh 2-3 kg and so the straps used to carry them are first investigated. Guitar straps are typically mounted over one shoulder only, as shown below:

The Miniature Smile could be carried in a similar way. Below is a review of how well this type of strap fulfills the objectives:

Would fulfill:
* Carry the weight of the Miniature Smile >2kg
* Not significantly increase weight of Smile
  * Should not weigh more than the current backpack design for the larger Smile
* Provide option for single-shoulder carrying
* Have ability to fit larger Smile by same attachments

Would be challenging to fulfill:
* Adjust to fit body size
* Be padded to provide comfortable fit for health worker
* Have strong attachments to smile box
* Provide option for backpack carrying
* Should carry the weight of the large Smile >3.5kg
* Integrate vaccine recording cards

Overall this mounting idea is simple to execute, however there would be a lot of challenges with getting it to fulfill all of the criteria.


#### Drum Strap

If the Miniature Smile is to be front mounted, a strap similar to that used to carry snare drums on parades could be used. An example of this is shown below:

![](https://github.com/Technology-for-the-Poorest-Billion/2024-ideabatic-smirk/blob/main/www/Photos/ToBeDeleted2.avif)

A strap like this would fulfill the following requirements:

Would fulfill:
* Carry the weight of the Miniature Smile >2kg
* Adjust to fit body size
* Not significantly increase weight of Smile
  * Should not weigh more than the current backpack design for the larger Smile

Would be challenging to fulfill:
* Be padded to provide comfortable fit for health worker
* Have strong attachments to Smile box
* Provide option for single-shoulder carrying
* Provide option for backpack carrying
* Have ability to fit larger smile by same attachments
* Should carry the weight of the large Smile >3.5kg
* Integrate vaccine recording cards

Although this idea initially seemed promising due to the similarities with a conventional rucksack with mounting straps over both shoulders, after evaluating against the requirements this idea performs poorly and should be discarded.


#### Suitcase Shoulder Straps

A shoulder strap system is available for suitcases whereby the suitcase is strapped to backpack-style straps and mounted on the user's back like a normal backpack. An image of such a system is included below:

![](https://github.com/Technology-for-the-Poorest-Billion/2024-ideabatic-smirk/blob/main/www/Photos/ToBeDeleted3.jpg)

This is evaluated below:

Would fulfill:
* Carry the weight of the Miniature Smile >2kg
* Adjust to fit body size
* Not significantly increase weight of Smile
  * Should not weigh more than the current backpack design for the larger Smile
* Be padded to provide comfortable fit for health worker
* Have strong attachments to Smile box
* Provide option for backpack carrying
* Have ability to fit larger smile by same attachments
* Should carry the weight of the large Smile >3.5kg
* Integrate vaccine recording cards

Would be challenging to fulfill:
* Provide option for single-shoulder carrying

This is the most promising idea by far and as such it is the one with which we'll proceed. Both the original and the Miniature Smile could be carried by these same set of straps, with adjustable fastening straps to fit hexagons of different sizes.
