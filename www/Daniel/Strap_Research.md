## Strap Research

#### Objectives

Functions the straps **must** perform:
* Carry the weight of the full smile >2kg
* Adjust to fit body size
* Not significantly increase weight of smile
  * Should not weigth more than the current backpack design for the larger smile
* Be padded to provide comfortable fit for health worker
* Have strong attatchments to smile box
  
Functions the straps **could** perform:
* Provide option for shoulder carrying
* Provide option for backpack carrying
* Have ability to fit larger smile by same attatchments
* could carry the weight of the large smile >3.5kg
* Integrate vaccine recoding cards


#### Guitar Strap

Guitars typically weigh 2-3 kg and so the straps used to carry them are first investigated. Guitar straps are typically mounted over one shoulder only, as shown below:

The Miniature Smile could be carried in a similar way. Below is a review of how well this type of strap fulfills the objectives:

Would fulfill:
* Carry the weight of the full smile >2kg
* Not significantly increase weight of smile
  * Should not weigth more than the current backpack design for the larger smile
* Provide option for shoulder carrying
* Have ability to fit larger smile by same attatchments

Would be challenging to fulfill:
* Adjust to fit body size
* Be padded to provide comfortable fit for health worker
* Have strong attatchments to smile box
* Provide option for backpack carrying
* could carry the weight of the large smile >3.5kg
* Integrate vaccine recoding cards

Overall this mounting idea is simple to execute, however there would be a lot of challenges with getting it to fulfill all of the criteria.


#### Drum Strap

If the Miniature Smile is to be front mounted, a strap similar to that used to carry snare drums on parades could be used. An example of this is shown below:

Investigate 2L Water backpacks
Flight suit record card pocket
Straps for carrying musical instrument cases - could be off the shelf to reduce manufacturing costs


Strap requirements:


Come up with strap design concepts and produce sketches bearing in mind ergonomics, mounting & modularity.
Make prototype.

Consider over the shoulder strap instead of backpack

Take a look at last year's work for strap stuff - don't repeat - Kitty's Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12QNKav0X3rGFk-dYRm6YgCxjDsl4oQKn?usp=sharing

Goal: Come up with different strap mounting mechanisms and produce rough 3D model/drawings then prototype. Be inspired by pre-existing designs such as guitar case mounting/cello case mounting etc. The problem with the current one is that it is too sharp and will dig into back.

Potentially ways to include storage pouch and vaccine recording sheet pouch in bag strap

Find things already out there for straps. Camelbaks for 2L water for example (already done for that weight)

Things to attach suitcase to back pack - also a thick shell.

Maybe make a market-research-type table to decide what needs to be bought/modified/strap attachment etc.
