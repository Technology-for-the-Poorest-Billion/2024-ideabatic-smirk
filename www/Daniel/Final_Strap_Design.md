## Final Strap Design

The suitcase-to-backpack conversion system style of straps is our final design and has been prototyped in cardboard for the Miniature Smile below:

The final strap design that was settled upon is of the suitcase-to-backpack conversion system style and a cardboard prototype is shown on this slide. We propose that the production version is formed of a stiff board of plywood to provide lower back support, and that this board is covered in foam so that the Miniature Smile remains comfortable to carry for extended periods of time. The straps would be made of a durable fabric, we suggest polyester, and would be connected to both the top and the bottom of the board so that the Miniature Smile can be carried hands-free. The straps mounting the Miniature Smile to the board should also be adjustable in length, allowing for the original Smile to also be mounted on the same backpack system. There will be a slot between the foam padding and the plywood board so that health workers can insert and store vaccination records there, whilst the stiff board protects these records and prevents creasing.
