Our solution has the following benefits:
We have managed to reduce the total volume of the Smile by 53%, aiding transportation​.
We have simplified the design by removing the side door so that it is less mechanically complex​.
Our new strap system is lighter, less bulky and more comfortable than the backpack for the original Smile, reducing user fatigue when carried over long distances.
The new strap system is simpler to produce so that an external contractor is no longer needed for the rucksack, reducing costs.
​The carousel only exsposes the vaccines that are in use to the enviroment​.
We have improved the modularity of the design allowing for easier dissassembly, maintenance and cleaning.

I started by studying the heat equation to try to come up with a relationship that relates A, the surface area of the bottle, V, the volume of the bottle, x, the wall thickness and lambda, the thermal conductivity of the insulation material, with the time that the vaccines are maintained between 2 and 8 degrees. The first equation on this slide is what I came up with. From Kitty's, our sponsor's, field trials we know that the Smile stays cold for around 5 days which is around 120 hours. From measuring the Smile we can determine that its insulation is approximately 5cm thick, and we know that the ice pack contains 2.5 L of water. Our Miniature Smile, is designed for much shorter journeys than the original Smile, and so we know that a cold time of only 24 hours would be suffuicient. The Miniature Smile is built around a 1 L ice pack, we assume that the thermal conductivity of the insulation will be unchanged, and we estimate through the scaling of similar shapes that the surface area of the Miniature Smile's ice pack will be 54% of that of the original Smile. By substituing these values into the first equation on this slide we obtain that the insulation thickness needed for the Miniature Smile, denoted as x_2, will be at least 2.6 cm.

Using the information gathered from the thermal analysis that the insulation thickness will need to be around 2.6cm, I then moved on to perform a mass analysis to guage how heavy the Miniature Smile will be. I came up with the first equation as as providing a reasonable approximation to the mass of the Smile, where all the symbols mean the same as for the thermal analysis. m_empty is the mass of the box with the ice pack empty, rho_m is the approximate density of the smile excluding the water in the ice pack, and rho_w is the density of water. rho_m is calculated by using a thin-wall assumption that the volume of the box excluding the water will be the insulation thickness multiplied by the surface area of the bottl, shown on the slide as the second equation. Although crude, I determined that this was a sufficiently accurate method given the approximate nature of the calculation. Calculating variables in the same way as for the thermal analysis, and weighing the Smile to obtain its mass as 3.5 kg, it is calculated that the Miniature Smile will have an empty weight of around 1kg and a full weight of around 2kg. This makes it significantly lighter, and thus significantly more portable, than the original Smile.

I started prototyping strap deigns to test for both the Miniature and original Smile. I started by creating a mock-up of the Mini Smile out of cardboard, using the dimensions determined from my thermal analysis, and mounted hook-like attachment points which I designed to allow interchangeable straps to be attached to both the Miniature and original Smile. This is shown in the left picture. This allows for user customisability as they are able to attach whichever strap configuration is most comfortable for them, whilst also allowing for the straps to be removed if the client wishes to use the box in its unaltered state. This prototype is shown with straps attached in the central image, and mounted on the user's back in the right image.

I then performed further research on different mounting mechanisms as suggested at the interim presentation. It was decided that the requirements that the proposal *must* satisfy were:
That it must carry the weight of the Miniature Smile.
That it must be able to adjust to fit various body sizes.​
That it must not significantly increase weight of Smile​.
That it must not weigh more than the current backpack design for the larger Smile​.
That it must be padded to provide comfortable fit for health worker​.
That it must have strong attachments to the Smile box​.

It would also be good if the proposal:
Provided the option for single-shoulder carrying​.
Provided the option for backpack carrying.​
Had the ability to fit the larger Smile by the sam.e attachments​.
Could carry the weight of the original Smile.
and Integrated vaccine recording cards.

The photos on the right of this slide show various proposals that were evaluated. Clockwise from the top left these were: straps attached to box to turn it into a standard rucksack, guitar-strap-style single shoulder strap, suitcase-conversion-to-backpack style straps, and marching-drum-style straps. I don't have time now to discuss the relative merits of each proposal, but these are detailed on our website and GitHub page.

The final strap design that was settled upon is of the suitcase-to-backpack conversion system style and a cardboard prototype is shown on this slide. We propose that the production version is formed of a stiff board of plywood to provide lower back support, and that this board is covered in foam so that the Miniature Smile remains comfortable to carry for extended periods of time. The straps would be made of a durable fabric, we suggest polyester, and would be connected to both the top and the bottom of the board so that the Miniature Smile can be carried hands-free. The straps mounting the Miniature Smile to the board should also be adjustable in length, allowing for the original Smile to also be mounted on the same backpack system. There will be a slot between the foam padding and the plywood board so that health workers can insert and store vaccination records there, whilst the stiff board protects these records and prevents creasing.
