For the production version we suggest that the back panel should consist of a stiff board of plywood covered in foam to provide lower back support whilst also providing padding so that the Miniature Smile remains comfortable to carry for extended periods of time. The straps should be made out of a durable fabric and connected to the both the top and the bottom of the board so that the user can carry the Miniature Smile hands-free, and the straps mounting the Miniature Smile to the board should be adjustable in length so that the original Smile could also be carried. A slot between the foam padding and the plywood board should be made so that health workers can insert and store vaccination records here, with the stiff board protecting the records and preventing creasing.
