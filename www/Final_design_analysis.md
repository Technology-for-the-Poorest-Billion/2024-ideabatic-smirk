# Thermal analysis of proposed final design

The final design will use the same insulation material, with the same thermal properties and thermal conductivity of 0.23 W/mK, and ABS shell as seen in the origional larger smile design.

The smaller smile has been designed to be compatible with the circular lids of the larger smile, fixing the insulation above and below the ice pack as 4cm thick. The radial insulation thickness can be reduced to 3.5 cm and can be axisymetric unlike in the origional smile design due to the removal of the side door. This reduces total volume significantly. The inner carousel chamber holding the ice pack will be lined with 0.5mm thick compressive, thermally conductive foam or heat pads. For the purpose of this analysis the thermal conductivity of this material will be 0.3 W/mK. The gap above and below the ice pack is 2.5mm.

## Inputs
T_atm = 27 degrees C <br>
T_ice_avg = -10 degrees C <br>
Ice bottle radius = 5cm <br>
Ice bottle height = 15cm <br>
Vaccine chamber radial dimension = 3cm <br>
Insulation thickness in radial direction = 3.5cm <br>
Insulation thickness along flat faces = 4.0cm <br>
Air gap above and below ice pack = 0.25cm <br>
Air gap around ice pack = 0.5cm <br>
lambda_shell = 0.18 W/mK for ABS shell <br>
lambda_ins = 0.023  W/mK
lambda_gap = 0.3 W/mK

## Results
### Lower bound for rate of heat transfer - assuming just conduction in air gap

The temperature profile from the top or bottom of the ice pack, out through one of the two hexagonal faces is shown below:
<br><img src="Photos/final_lin.png" alt="Temperature profile through thickness of mini smile" width="600"/>
<br>The rate of heat transferred from the two flat faces is, **Q_dot_l = 0.670 J/s**.
The height of the mini smile with insulation thickness of 4cm is 22cm, so has a lightly greater improvement on the large smile in this dimension.

The temperature profile from the ice block to the rectangular walls, in a radial direction is shown below, with only conduction effects considered in the air gap.
<br><img src="Photos/final_LB.png" alt="Temperature profile through radial walls" width="600"/>
<br>The rate of heat transferred from the radial face is, **Q_dot_r = 1.286 J/s**.
The diameter of the small smile with 4cm insulation is approx. 23cm which is a reduction of 10cm from the large smile.

This shows the face limiting the cool life is the radial face as in the large model.
By approximating the box as the radial and linear resistor systems in parallel the total heat transferred out of the cooler is,
**Q_dot: 1.956 J/s** giving a cool life, with the vaccines below 8 degrees C, of **63.5 hours**.

### Upper bound for rate of heat transfer - assuming conduction and convection in air gap

The temperature profile from the ice block to the rectangular walls, in a radial direction is shown below, with convection effects now considered in the air gap as well as conduction.
<br><img src="Photos/final_UB.png" alt="Temperature profile through radial walls" width="600"/>
<br>The rate of heat transferred from the radial face is, **Q_dot_r = 2.491 J/s**.

The total heat transferred out of the cooler is, **Q_dot: 3.161 J/s** giving a cool life, with the vaccines below 8 degrees C, of **39.3 hours**.

This implies the true cool life of a small smile will lie between 39.3 hours < t < 63.5 hours. This suggests that the 3.5cm radial insulation, with the 4cm insulated lids, would provide a sufficient cool life for the shorter and up to 24 hour last mile journeys.
