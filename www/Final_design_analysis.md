# Thermal analysis of proposed final design

The final design will use the same insulation material, with the same thermal properties and thermal conductivity of 0.23 W/mK, and ABS shell as seen in the origional larger smile design.

The smaller smile has been designed to be compatible with the circular lids of the larger smile, fixing the insulation above and below the ice pack as 4cm thick. The radial insulation thickness can be reduced to 3.5 cm and can be axisymetric unlike in the origional smile design due to the removal of the side door. This reduces total volume significantly. The inner carousel chamber holding the ice pack will be lined with 0.5mm thick compressive, thermally conductive foam or heat pads. For the purpose of this analysis the thermal conductivity of this material will be 0.3 W/mK.
