# Dan Planning


## Objectives to be completed before monday:
Present a summary of team members' personal and technical development (what
have you learnt and how have you learned it?);

Since last presentation I have developed my rapid protoyping skills, using cardboard to speed up the process, and my high-level analysis by performing back-of-the-envelope calculations for the Mini Smile's mass and insulation thickness. In terms of personal development I have furthered my teamworking and communication skills by working closely with Livvy and Caio throughout the project.




Practice 5 minute presentation a couple of times


Come up with strap design concepts and produce sketches bearing in mind ergonomics, mounting & modularity.
Make prototype.
