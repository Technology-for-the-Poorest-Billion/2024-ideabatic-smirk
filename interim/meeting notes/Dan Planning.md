# Dan Planning

Come up with strap design concepts and produce sketches bearing in mind ergonomics, mounting & modularity.
Make prototype.

Consider over the shoulder strap instead of backpack

Take a look at last year's work for strap stuff - don't repeat - Kitty's Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12QNKav0X3rGFk-dYRm6YgCxjDsl4oQKn?usp=sharing

Goal: Come up with different strap mounting mechanisms and produce rough 3D model/drawings then prototype. Be inspired by pre-existing designs such as guitar case mounting/cello case mounting etc. The problem with the current one is that it is too sharp and will dig into back.
