# Dan Planning

Come up with strap design concepts and produce sketches bearing in mind ergonomics, mounting & modularity.
Make prototype.

Consider over the shoulder strap instead of backpack

Take a look at last year's work for strap stuff - don't repeat - Kitty's Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12QNKav0X3rGFk-dYRm6YgCxjDsl4oQKn?usp=sharing

Goal: Come up with different strap mounting mechanisms and produce rough 3D model/drawings then prototype. Be inspired by pre-existing designs such as guitar case mounting/cello case mounting etc. The problem with the current one is that it is too sharp and will dig into back.

Potentially ways to include storage pouch and vaccine recording sheet pouch in bag strap

Find things already out there for straps. Camelbaks for 2L water for example (already done for that weight)

Things to attach suitcase to back pack - also a thick shell.

Maybe make a market-research-type table to decide what needs to be bought/modified/strap attachment etc.
