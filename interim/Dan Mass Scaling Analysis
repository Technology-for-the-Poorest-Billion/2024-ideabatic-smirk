# Mass Scaling Analysis

Mass of the Smirk:
## $\frac{m_1}{m_2} = \frac{\rho_wV_1+\rho_mA_1x_1}{\rho_wV_2+\rho_mA_2x_2}$
where $A$ is the surface area of the bottle, $V$ is the volume of the bottle, $x$ is the wall thickness, $\rho_w$ is the density of water and $\rho_m$ is the approximate calculated density of the insulaton and shell combined.
$V_1 = 0.0025$ m$^3$


We know that $t_1$ is approximately 120 hours, $x_1$ is approximately 5cm and $V_1$ is 2.5L for the original Smile.
We want $t_2 > 24$ hours for Smirk, and we know that $V_2 = 1$L, $\frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1} = 1$ and $\frac{A_2}{A_1} = 0.54$, therefore we need:
## $x_2 > 2.6$ cm
