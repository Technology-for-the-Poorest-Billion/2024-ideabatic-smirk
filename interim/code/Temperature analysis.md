## Objective

To perform a basic thermal analysis with variable input parameters that can be changed to investigate the effect or insulation thickness, ice block size, insulation material and ambient temperature on the cool-time and temperature range of the vaccine chamber for example.

We wanted to investigate how much we could reduce the insulation thickness, also have the ability to test insulation, and shell materials with different thermal properties.
