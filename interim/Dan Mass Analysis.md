# Mass Analysis

Mass of the Smirk:
## $m = \rho_wV+\rho_mAx$
Therefore:
## $\frac{m_1}{m_2} = \frac{\rho_wV_1+\rho_mA_1x_1}{\rho_wV_2+\rho_mA_2x_2}$
where $A$ is the surface area of the bottle, $V$ is the volume of the bottle, $x$ is the wall thickness, $\rho_w$ is the density of water and $\rho_m$ is the approximate calculated density of the insulaton and shell combined.
$V_1 = 0.0025 m^3$, $V_2 = 0.001 m^3$, $\rho_w = 1000 kgm^{-3}$, $x_1 = 0.055 m$ and $m_1 = INSERT NUMBERkg$. Therefore,
## $\rho_m = \frac{m_1 - \rho_wV_1}{A_1x_1} = INSERT NUMBER$

Hence:

## $m_2 = INSERT EQUATION = INSERT NUMBER$
