We began by talking to Kitty with what she would like us to do. She got
us started on looking into the UK market, and what applications the box
would work on. We looked into the currently available options, but none
of them seemed appropriate. We asked for kittys market research, and
found that typically vaccination travel rounds last for upwards of 5
hours, which is already enough that a medic may not wish to extend this
time further.

We talked to personal connections we know to see if there would be a
smaller personal ice box market, however this also backfired, as most
people in that market would not need their medication cold dor much
longer than a few hours, and can do so with a small box when on holiday
etc.

The conclusion we came to was that the NHS market was no good. We
proposed a second market to Kitty of a third world country where the
journeys are less dangerous than those currently taken, but still
require a lot of vaccinations in one go. We then looked at current large
capacity cold boxes, and how the existing smile addresses those issues.

Current options… £500 gets you an electric vaccine cooler, so need to
lower the price towards the £200 range. Looking at insulation can be
useful to try and reduce cost, but can let kitty do this as it would be
more involved for the manufacturing process.

All options seem to be just boxes with handles and seem to be very
expensive. Smile does fix this sort of.
