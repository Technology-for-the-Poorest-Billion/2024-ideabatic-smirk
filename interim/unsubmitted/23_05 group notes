Doing rapid designs of these:
Dan working straps
Caio focussing on making carousel modular
Livvy looking at making shell and insulation smaller (ties in with thermal design)
Split so can each focus on one area and then can peer review each other's work to help improve/narrow down after so still a team effort

What's been done:
Caio done more market research and written up what found
Dan done scaling analysis to work out required thickness ofinsulation for box
Livvy doing heat transfer analysis for insulation shape and material
