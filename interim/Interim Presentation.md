# Interim Report

# Caio

We began by talking to Kitty with what she would like us to do. She got
us started on looking into the UK market, and what applications the box
would work on. We looked into the currently available options, but none
of them seemed appropriate. We asked for kittys market research, and
found that typically vaccination travel rounds last for upwards of 5
hours, which is already enough that a medic may not wish to extend this
time further.

We talked to personal connections we know to see if there would be a
smaller personal ice box market, however this also backfired, as most
people in that market would not need their medication cold dor much
longer than a few hours, and can do so with a small box when on holiday
etc.

The conclusion we came to was that the NHS market was no good. We
proposed a second market to Kitty of a third world country where the
journeys are less dangerous than those currently taken, but still
require a lot of vaccinations in one go. We then looked at current large
capacity cold boxes, and how the existing smile addresses those issues.

Current options… £500 gets you an electric vaccine cooler, so need to
lower the price towards the £200 range. Looking at insulation can be
useful to try and reduce cost, but can let kitty do this as it would be
more involved for the manufacturing process.

All options seem to be just boxes with handles and seem to be very
expensive. Smile does fix this sort of.

## Thermal Analysis

Time that the Smirk can maintain vaccine between 2 and 8 degrees:
### $\frac{t_1}{t_2} = \frac{x_1^2A_2V_1\lambda_2}{x_2^2A_1V_2\lambda_1}$
where $A$ is the surface area of the bottle, $V$ is the volume of the bottle, $x$ is the wall thickness and $\lambda$ is the heat conductivity of the insulation material. We know that $t_1$ is approximately 120 hours, $x_1$ is approximately 5 cm and $V_1$ is 2.5 L for the original Smile.
We want $t_2 > 24$ hours for Smirk, and we know that $V_2 = 1$ L, $\frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1} = 1$ and $\frac{A_2}{A_1} = 0.54$, therefore we need:
### $x_2 > 2.6$ cm


## Mass Analysis

Mass of the Smirk:
### $m = m_{empty} + \rho_wV = \rho_mAx + \rho_wV$
where $A$ is the surface area of the bottle, $V$ is the volume of the bottle, $x$ is the wall thickness, $\rho_w$ is the density of water and $\rho_m$ is the approximate calculated density of the insulaton and shell combined.
$V_1 = 0.0025$ m<sup>3</sup>, $V_2 = 0.001$ m<sup>3</sup>, $\rho_w = 1000$ kg/m<sup>3</sup>, $x_1 = 0.055$ m, $x_2 = 0.026$ m, $A_1 = 0.003$ m<sup>2</sup>, $A_2 = 0.0016$ m<sup>2</sup> and $m_{1,empty} = 3.5$ kg. Therefore,
### $\rho_m = \frac{m_{1,empty}}{A_1x_1}$
Hence,
### $m_{2,empty} = \rho_mA_2x_2 = 0.9$ kg
### $m_2 = m_{2,empty} + \rho_wV_2 = 1.9$ kg

## Strap Design

I have started prototyping different modular strap designs to test for both the Smile and the Smirk. I started by creating a mock-up of the Smile out of cardboard, shown below:

![](https://github.com/Technology-for-the-Poorest-Billion/2024-ideabatic-smirk/blob/main/interim/photographs/IMG_20240525_181334368.jpg)

I then designed and prototyped modular attaching clips which can be glued to botht the Smile and the Smirk. These allow interchangeable straps to be attached to the Smile/Smirk, and thus allow user customisability to attach whatever strap configuration is most comfortable for them. The straps can also be removed, allowing the box to be used un-altered as before. Photographs of the attachment points are below:

![](https://github.com/Technology-for-the-Poorest-Billion/2024-ideabatic-smirk/blob/main/interim/photographs/IMG_20240525_181409278.jpg)

Straps were then prototyped out of cardboard with a width of 40mm. I plan on trying these out, along with 70mm-wide straps on a field test where I walk around with the Smile protoype weighted to the correct mass. This will allow me to identify which set of straps is more ergonomic, and the modularity of the strap-retaining mechanism glued to the box means that both I, and any end user, can easily swap of straps for the most comfortable for them. Perhaps it will be suggested that the default Smile straps are thicker than the default Smirk ones due to the higher anticipated weight of the Smile. However the straps will of course be interchangeable. Here are some photographs of the straps:

And how they attach to the box:

I have completed some preliminary field tests with the straps, and these are photographed below:

![](https://github.com/Technology-for-the-Poorest-Billion/2024-ideabatic-smirk/blob/main/interim/photographs/IMG_3840.jpeg)

![](https://github.com/Technology-for-the-Poorest-Billion/2024-ideabatic-smirk/blob/main/interim/photographs/IMG_3839.jpeg)

I have also explored the possibility of front-mounting the Smirk. Advantages of this include enhanced protection for the vaccines (unlikely to bump the Smirk into things), and possible on-the-fly acces to the Smirk's contents.

![](https://github.com/Technology-for-the-Poorest-Billion/2024-ideabatic-smirk/blob/main/interim/photographs/IMG_20240525_155927525.jpg)

At the moment the straps have to be held to keep the Smirk in place, but I am exploring options for lengthening the straps and attaching both ends to the Smirk so that it can be carried hands-free.
