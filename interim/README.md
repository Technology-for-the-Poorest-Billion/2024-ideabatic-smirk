# Scaling Thermal Analysis

Time that the Smirk can maintain vaccine between 2 and 8 degrees for:
## $\frac{t_1}{t_2} = \frac{x_1^2A_2V_1\lambda_2}{x_2^2A_1V_2\lambda_1}$
where $A$ is the surface area of the bottle, $V$ is the volume of the bottle, $x$ is the wall thickness and $\lambda$ is the heat conductivity of the insulation material. We know that $t_1$ is approximately 120 hours, $x_1$ is approximately 5cm and $V_1$ is 2.5L for the original Smile.
We want $t_2 > 24$ hours for Smirk, and we know that $V_2 = 1$ L, $\frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1} = 1$ and $\frac{A_2}{A_1} = 0.54$ therefore we need:
## $x_2 > 2.6$ cm
