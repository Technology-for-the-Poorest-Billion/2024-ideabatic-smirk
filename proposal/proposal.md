# Problem description

The problem we are tackling is that of last mile vaccine transportation to rural areas in high income countries. These areas include rural areas of Scotland and Wales, and will often be to people who are immobile and unable to travel to a vaccination centre, such as the elderly. Current vaccination transportation cool boxes are poorly designed, and as a result vaccination workers often don't use them properly with too few ice packs being used and the box lid being left off during vaccination. This results in a significant portion of cool boxes where the temperature exceeds the allowed 2 to 8 degree range and so the vaccines spoil. Our goal is to reduce the amount of vaccine spoilt by creating a well-designed cooler that mitigates the above problems. The engineering approach we will use is to model prototypes in CAD software before using novel manufacturing techniques such as 3D printing to create physical prototypes. Should we have time, we will then run tests on these prototypes.

# Presentation of the proposal
We will begin with defining the problem, isolating the key components and determining their importance in the final design. This will help us get a feel for the current design and design considerations that must be taken when determining what to shrink, and how that would best be done. We will begin by looking at the threee major parts of the project: The lid, the carousel, and the box itself, and we will try and make it smaller so as to fit the 1L ice pack proposed by Kitty. 

After coming up with and iterating on the designs on paper, we will begin rudimentary 3d modelling of the final sketches, and start 3d printing said models to analyse what works and what doesn't. After the rapid prototyping and testing against the provided box, we will begin to refine our best ideas and attempt to create a more finalised 3d model which will be be ready to be delivered and in a finished state for the route we go down. Due to the time constraints, a full model with testing of the completed scaled down version may not be feasible, however rough calculations will be made so as to ensure the ice box will work for prolonged periods of time at a reasonable scale.
