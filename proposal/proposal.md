# Problem description

The problem we are tackling is that of last mile vaccine transportation to rural areas in high income countries. These areas include rural areas of Scotland and Wales, and will often be to people who are immobile and unable to travel to a vaccination centre, such as the elderly. Current vaccination transportation cool boxes are poorly designed, and as a result vaccination workers often don't use them properly with too few ice packs being used and the box lid being left off during vaccination. This results in a significant portion of cool boxes where the temperature exceeds the allowed 2 to 8 degree range and so the vaccines spoil. Our goal is to reduce the amount of vaccine spoilt by creating a well-designed cooler that mitigates the above problems. The engineering approach we will use is to model prototypes in CAD software before using novel manufacturing techniques such as 3D printing to create physical prototypes. Should we have time, we will then run tests on these prototypes.

# Presentation of the proposal
We will begin with rapid prototyping, looking at ways to simplify the design through brainstorming and rudimentary paper models. This will help us get a feel for the current design and design considerations that must be taken. We will look at the threee major parts of the project: The lid, the carousel, and the box itself, and we will try and make it smaller so as to fit the 1L ice pack proposed by Kitty. We will begin by attempting to come up with a cohesive design between the three of us. After rapid prototyping and testing against the provided box, we will begin to select our best ideas and attempt to create a more rigid 3d model which will allow us to review the effectiveness and the feasibility of our proposed solutions. Due to the time constraints, a full model with testing of the completed scaled down version may not be feasible.

# Assessment of the quality of the proposal

Evaluate its value in the context of the project. What will it solve, is it safe, etc. Check Laraâ€™s slides for what to cover.
