# Problem description

The problem we are tackling is that of last mile vaccine transportation to rural areas in high income countries. These areas include rural areas of Scotland and Wales, and will often be to people who are immobile and unable to travel to a vaccination centre, such as the elderly. Current vaccination transportation cool boxes are poorly designed, and as a result vaccination workers often don't use them properly with too few ice packs being used and the box lid being left off during vaccination. This results in a significant portion of cool boxes where the temperature exceeds the allowed 2 to 8 degree range and so the vaccines spoil. Our goal is to reduce the amount of vaccine spoilt by creating a well-designed cooler that mitigates the above problems. The engineering approach we will use is to model prototypes in CAD software before using novel manufacturing techniques such as 3D printing to create physical prototypes. Should we have time, we will then run tests on these prototypes.
