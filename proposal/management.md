# Project management plan

## Skills required for project

CAD, prototyping, GitHub, 3D printing, laser cutting, mechanism design


## The people


Olivia's strengths: materials, heat transfer, prototyping, teamwork, laser cutting

Caio's strengths: materials, mechanisms, CAD, 3D printing, teamwork

Daniel's strengths: structures, mechanisms, prototyping, teamwork


Olivia's weaknesses: GitHub, CAD, structures

Caio's weaknesses: GitHub, heat transfer, structures, laser cutting

Daniel's weaknesses: GitHub, CAD, materials, laser cutting

## Training needed

Daniel, Caio and Olivia need to learn how to use GitHub

Daniel and Olivia need CAD training from Caio

Daniel and Olivia need 3D printing training from Caio/Dyson Centre staff

Daniel and Caio need laser cutting training from Olivia/Dyson Centre staff


## The resources needed


Costing, parts required


## The timeline

Need to present a development timeline!!!



## The assessment of the risks and safety

Using 3D printer, laser cutters and prototyping can be dangerous.



# 3D printer:

We will not stand around the 3D printer when it is running to minimise the inhalation of particulates being created and exposure to chemical vapors.

We will not eat or drink in the room that contains the 3D printer.

We will wash our hands thoroughly after working with the 3D printer.

For more information refer to the following departmental guidance document: https://whittle-intranet.eng.cam.ac.uk/3Dprinterriskassessment20151027.pdf


# Laser cutter:

Refer to the following departmental guidance document: https://www.dysoncentre.eng.cam.ac.uk/laser-cutting/Risk_assessment_laser_cutters.pdf

# Prototyping:

We will be careful when using sharp cutting implements and make sure that there are at least two more people in the Dyson Centre when completing work - one person to help us and another person to call an ambulance if something goes wrong.

We will always place hot glue guns back on their stands when not in use, and won't ever place our hands below them to avoid burns if hot glue gun glue drips.

We will wear safety glasses so that we don't get foreign objects in our eyes.
