# Project management plan

## Skills required for project

CAD, prototyping, GitHub, 3D printing, laser cutting, mechanism design


## The people


Olivia's strengths: materials, heat transfer, prototyping, teamwork, laser cutting

Caio's strengths: materials, mechanisms, CAD, 3D printing, teamwork

Daniel's strengths: structures, mechanisms, prototyping, teamwork


Olivia's weaknesses: GitHub, CAD, structures

Caio's weaknesses: GitHub, heat transfer, structures, laser cutting

Daniel's weaknesses: GitHub, CAD, materials, laser cutting

## Training needed

Daniel, Caio and Olivia need to learn how to use GitHub

Daniel and Olivia need CAD training from Caio

Daniel and Olivia need 3D printing training from Caio/Dyson Centre staff

Daniel and Caio need laser cutting training from Olivia/Dyson Centre staff


## The resources needed

As this project involves rapid prototyping of multiple design iterations it is hard to predict how much of each resource we will require, so an estimation is below: 

| Resources     | Cost          |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1L ice pack   | £5            |
| wood and plastic for laser cutting  | £15 |
|material for 3D printer |£25|

## The timeline

A more detailed timeline is available, however the broad strokes are:
Have a product definition and order of importance by the first few days
Have rapid brainstorming and sketching/prototyping sessions just before the halfway point of the second week.
Spend a week working on physical prototypes for the solutions, and coming up with well documented design decisions leading to a final product
Have the last few days reserved for presenting the deliverables and making the report

## The assessment of the risks and safety

#### 3D printer:

| Hazard        | Control measure | Risk level |
| ------------- | --------------  |------------|
| Inhalation of particulates created and exposure to chemical vapors | Do not stand around 3D printer whilst in operation <br>Do not eat or drink in the room containing 3D printer<br>Wash hands thoroughly after working with 3D printer| Medium |
| Risk of burns | Avoid touching printing nozzle head and molten plastic <br>Let part cool before handling  | Medium |

For more information refer to the following departmental guidance document: https://whittle-intranet.eng.cam.ac.uk/3Dprinterriskassessment20151027.pdf


#### Laser cutter:

| Hazard        | Control measure | Risk level |
| ------------- | --------------  |------------|
| Poisoning/gassing by fumes from material being cut | Be aware of hazards from materials being cut <br>Ensure fume filter is running at sufficient speed| Medium |
| Risk of burns | Don't leave machine unattended, and watch for flames <br>Don't cut highly flammable materials | Medium |
|Entrapment of hand or arm by moving cutting head causing crush injury|Alwyas operate mahine with lid shut <br>Don’t place hands or arms in the potential path of the cutting head unnecessarily|Low|

For more information refer to the following departmental guidance document: https://www.dysoncentre.eng.cam.ac.uk/laser-cutting/Risk_assessment_laser_cutters.pdf

#### Prototyping:

| Hazard        | Control measure | Risk level |
| ------------- | --------------  |------------|
| Injury from sharp cutting implements| Be careful when using sharp cutting tools <br>Make sure that there are at least two more people in the Dyson Centre when completing work - one person to help us and another person to call an ambulance if something goes wrong|Medium|
|Burns from hot glue gun| Always place hot glue guns back on stand when not in use <br>Don't place hands below them incase glue gun drips| Low|
|Foreign objects danger to eyes |Wear safety glasses| Low|


## Contengency plans

#### Timeline
Days have been allocated so as to allow for falling somewhat behind schedule, while still allowing time for a final presentation and creation of the report. This would let us keep the scope in check, and getting to at least one concrete finished product, as opposed to some half finished segments of the same product. If this allotted extra time is still not enough, we will try to limit the final 3D printing phase, and focus more on the ideas and reasoning behind them, as well as their CAD models. This staged approach to a few key aspects allows us to scale back if need be, but also allows us to have a deliverable. It also does not rely soley on a single person, so as to remove potential risks of delay.

#### Failure to produce a working design
If the outcome of the project is proving a certian design is not viable this would still be useful information to pass on to Kitty. By maintaining detailed documentation of our processes and reasoning we can prevent the same designs being re-explored, saving time in future prototyping.
