As many vaccines as fit around the 1 litre cool pack - wokr this out from the bottle's surface area and put on project proposal
Goal is for it to keep cold for at least 24 hours
Aim for a model on CAD and a 3D printout as deliverables
Then can stick a thermal blanket inside our 3D printed shell to do a thermal test at the end


Probably have more of a focus on mechanisms (eg. door, carousel mechanism etc)
3 weeks is not a lot of time
