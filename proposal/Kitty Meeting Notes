As many vaccines as fit around the 1 litre cool pack - wokr this out from the bottle's surface area and put on project proposal
Goal is for it to keep cold for at least 24 hours
Aim for a model on CAD and a 3D printout as deliverables
Then can stick a thermal blanket inside our 3D printed shell to do a thermal test at the end


Probably have more of a focus on mechanisms (eg. door, carousel mechanism etc)
3 weeks is not a lot of time
Try to find a way to suspend 1L bottle in the middle of the device without bearings (as on the larger model)
  - if at end think that bearing is still the best method then just use bearing


Squidgy ice pack door was particular challenge for Kitty when designing full size smile
  - inital hard first design did not alklow for expansion when freezing
Initial door angle was too small so it was too small and difficult to get vaccines out
  - Made angle of vacicne door longer
Try and find a way to put vaccine record paper thing on device
Don't try and make it too sophisticated at this stage - just get soemthing modelled out and start printing out


Things to consider:
  IP55 waterproofing - much less important in the developed world
  Dustproof - much less important in the developed world
  Spring lifetime
  Opening angle
  Stay closed during transport
  Ergonomic - what happens if someone's fingers get trapped in the door?


Use google drive instead of github - probably keep github on private as Kitty thinks it's just for code and there's no code involved involved with this project
Kitty much prefers Google Drive as she doesn't have github brain
