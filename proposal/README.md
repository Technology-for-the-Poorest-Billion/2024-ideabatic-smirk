## The proposal

Use this folder to present your proposal. Two markdown files, `proposal.md` and `management.md`, suggest a structure you may follow to cover the required content. Fill free to use them, or adjust them to your taste.

You may find it useful to include link, tables, figures, etc. There are plenty of tutorials [online](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) showing you how to use markdown.

Keep it concise and simple here.

If you present a few slides, please also include them here too **as a pdf**.



### Images and other resources

If you need to include images and other technical resources, place them in the `assets` folder and insert them or link to them, as in the example below. (You can check the source of this markdown file.)

![The sustainable development goals.](assets/SDG_source_UN.org.svg)


### A table

Here is also a simple table!

| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |


You can of course change or delete this file and the sample image in the assets folder.

For super-and sub-scripts: a<sub>1</sub> = 12 ms<sup>-2</sup>.

You can also include formulae in LaTeX syntax: $\alpha=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$.
